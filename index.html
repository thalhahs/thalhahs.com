        <p>
          My journey is a mix of languages and technology. I am currently
          studying Arabic Language at LIPIA Jakarta and Arabic Language at the
          Islamic University of Madinah. Along the way, I started experimenting
          with technology as a beginner—first learning HTML and CSS to build
          simple websites, then exploring Java and even creating small games
          using Scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curiosity pushed me further into mobile development, where I tried
          Android with Java and Kotlin, and later discovered the flexibility of
          Dart and Flutter for cross-platform apps. At the same time, I became
          interested in IoT and began learning with Arduino, combining software
          and hardware in fun beginner projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am still at the early stage of this journey, but every step makes me
          more excited to keep learning and growing.

        <p class="date">May 2017 – June 2020 | Bogor, Indonesia</p>
        <p>
          I have explored various aspects of technology and programming. I
          started with the basics of web development through HTML and CSS, which
          gave me a foundation in designing and structuring websites. I then
          moved on to learning Java, which allowed me to understand
          object-oriented programming concepts. Additionally, I have experience
          in creating simple games using Scratch, a visual programming platform
          that helped me build creativity and problem-solving skills in a fun
          way. HTML CSS Java Scratch

        <p class="date">August 2020 – May 2023 | Bogor, Indonesia</p>
        <p>
          I have begun studying Android development with Java and Kotlin, while
          also getting introduced to Dart and Flutter for cross-platform app
          development. In addition, I am learning about the Internet of Things
          (IoT) through Arduino, which has given me valuable hands-on experience
          connecting software with hardware. Although I am still at an early
          stage, I am very enthusiastic about growing my skills in these areas.

          My experience began with our family business, a carwash we built from
          the ground up. I started as the only worker, later becoming the
          cashier who managed daily finance and stock control. Over time, I took
          on marketing to bring in more customers and improve loyalty. I also
          had to handle employees, interact directly with customers, and even
          take care of technical details to ensure operations ran smoothly.
          Through this journey, I mastered every aspect of the business, from
          the smallest detail to overall management
